# What

This project contains Wiki entries that tracks my Open Source activities.
It can be thought of as a sort of diary; or perhaps what blogs used to be originally.

Actual entries are in [Wiki](MyOpenSourceDiary/wiki).

## Other publishing activity

My main blog used to be [CowTalk](http://cowtowncoder.com/blog/blog.html)
but nowadays I blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder).

## Related projects

Most activities are within projects under following repos:

* [@cowtowncoder](https://github.com/cowtowncoder) (personal)
* [FasterXML](https://github.com/FasterXML) ("official" Jackson, Woodstox, Aalto)
